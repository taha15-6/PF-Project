OVERVIEW:
The game is set in the magical kingdom, where the player acts 
as a noble king and embarks on a quest to rescue the queen from 
a vile magician. The game has three levels and features a unique 
panel layout with obstacles and challenges representing each. 
The player moves across a 10x10 board using the w/a/s/d keys 
and must reach the queen while dodging or fighting enemies. 
The player guides the king through the king’s stations, 
encountering enemies and obstacles with the goal of reaching 
the queen’s place.
